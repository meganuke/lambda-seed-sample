# Lamda Seed Example

This is a sample of how to use the lambda-seed library with the lambda-pod project

## Still WIP

make sure to set the .env variables and execute the migration first.

to run locally use: `serverless offline`

to deploy to an aws dev environment use: `serverless deploy`

for the next release you will need to setup the lambda-pod project, because you will need the parameter store and secrets manager, even if running locally.
